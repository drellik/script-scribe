# script-scribe
Script writing and editing software
_by Patrick McClellan_

Software designed to make writing a script easy.
This software will allow you to easy format a script as if you were just typing a letter.

**Instructions:**
Scene Header (Slugline) - At the beginning of a line start typing I or E then press tab.
      The INT. or EXT. will auto complete and you can describe your scene until you press enter.

Character - Press tab and your text will be centered and capitalized for you to write the characters name.

Dialog - Once you type your characters name and press enter you will automatically be formatted to type your dialog.

Action - Press enter twice from dialog and you will be back to typing action and plot for your script.

Parenthetical Direction - When you are in dialog mode, if you press tab, you will be able to type direction in parenthesis.

**Contribute:**
I look forward to contributions to this project.
It is written in C# with Visual Studio Community 2015
